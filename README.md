# TrainingManager

TrainingManager was created as a bit of fun while I was learning how to build web app's using the .NET framework/procrastinating from more important stuff.

Check it out at http://trainingmanageruat.azurewebsites.net/.

## Extras

The home page title CSS was borrowed from https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ayBeQZ. Big ups to CAPTAIN ANONYMOUS!

The app uses kartik-v's bootstrap-star-rating CSS and JS libraries for the UI star rating displays.
